Introduction

This project  explores the USA Names dataset from the BigQuery public data repository to analyze baby names in the United States from 1910 to 2013. The project demonstrates advanced SQL techniques to extract meaningful insights, including:

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to simplify complex queries.
- Temporary Tables for managing intermediate results.
- Window Functions to rank names and calculate trends over time.
- Aggregate Functions to summarize data such as totals and counts.
- Views for efficient data retrieval.
- Query Optimization for performance improvements on large datasets.
- Subqueries to enhance filtering and calculations.
- Data Type Conversions to ensure correct data manipulation.

The analysis includes tasks like identifying the top baby names by gender, ranking names by decade, calculating the year-over-year growth of a specific name, and more. These queries demonstrate the versatility and power of SQL for performing complex data analysis on large datasets.
